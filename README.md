# Searching nearest neighbour Algorithms

Implementation of searching algorithms to find the most similar images. This project is using the Mnist dataset. 
The algorithms that have been implemented in this project are : 

- Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) 
- HyperCube Stucture
- Graph Search Algorithms (GNNs, MRNG construction) 
- Cluster (Kmeans++, Macqueen)

# Compilation & Run

In order to compile and run a technique you must choose (filename) : lsh, cube, graph_search, cluster  
    
    compile : make
    run     : ./filename.c

# Algorithms Results

As you can see there is a **data** file. In this file the results of the algorithms are stored. 
Except this there are graph models for different data dimensions. The autoencoder that it is uploaded to my profile is being used here.
You can observe that the time of the lower dimension data is way less than the normal dimension of the data.
